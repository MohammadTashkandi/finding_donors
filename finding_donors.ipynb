    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "| Question | Answer |\n",
    "| :---------- | :---------- |\n",
    "| Real-world application | Can be used to predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease |\n",
    "| Strengths | 1- Tends not to overfit<br>2- By using weak learners to build a model, it tends to be more accurate than its parts. |\n",
    "| Weaknesses | 1- Sensitive to outliers<br>2- Needs quality data |\n",
    "| What makes this a good candidate? | By combining small decision trees (which in itself is a good algorithm to use on our problem) we can get a more accurate prediction than just using a single decision tree |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2- Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "| Question | Answer |\n",
    "| :---------- | :---------- |\n",
    "| Real-world application | Can be used in the stock market when you want analyze the behaviour of the market. It can also show the expected loss or profit gained from buying a stock. |\n",
    "| Strengths | 1- High accuracy<br> 2- Does very well with large amount of data<br>3- It can judge the importance of a feature |\n",
    "| Weaknesses | 1- Due to its nature, its quite complex<br> 2- High computation costs, and uses a lot of memory<br> |\n",
    "| What makes this a good candidate? | Because its made of small decision trees its suits our problem well. What makes it even better is that Random Forests do well when given large amounts of data and features (which is evident in our problem) |\n",

    "\n",
    "| Question | Answer |\n",
    "| :---------- | :---------- |\n",
    "| Real-world application | Can be used for face detection. It classifies the image as a face and non-face and create a square boundary around the face. |\n",
    "| Strengths | 1- SVMs do extremely complex data transformation which allows you to capture very complex relationships between your datapoints without having to perform difficult transformations on your own<br>2- The risk of overfitting is low compared to other algorithms<br>3- It scales relatively well to high dimensional data<br>4- Very good when we have no idea on the data |\n",
    "| Weaknesses | 1- The results of SVM are difficult to interpret due to the complex data transfomations applied<br>2- It takes a lot of time and computation time<br>3- Choosing its hyper-parameters is difficult, and its hard to visualize their impact |\n",
    "| What makes this a good candidate? | Since our data has a lot of features to take into account, it might be hard to classify a person as >50K or <=50K. Thats where SVMs come in, it can find non-linear boundaries that classify the model in a much better way compared to other models. |\n",

    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",

    "\n",
    "AdaBoost is a model that classifies the data multiple times, but each time assigning different weights to each classification and data points until we get the best model. Now thats too abstact so lets get into details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets say we have a large dataset of emails and we want to classify the dataset into either spam or ham, so we can predict whether an incoming email is spam or not. We can use -for example- a decision tree to classify these data points, and it will do the trick. But the accuracy of our predictions (and our classification) won't be anything spectacular. Sometimes the model might classify a spam email as not spam and vice versa. In comes AdaBoost. AdaBoost does a similar thing as what we humans do when we want to make an important decision, we ask for more than one opinion. But obviously we won't listen to a 9 year old as much as we listen to a wise old man. Hey, thats what AdaBoost does too!\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more specific, What AdaBoost does is:\n",
    "- First, assign a weight to all points, then gets a decision tree and makes it classify our dataset (first opinion), this decision tree's opinion's weight will be low (our 9 year old). Now obviously, this first classification will get some data points wrong. \n",
    "- AdaBoost will then assign a larger weight to the data points that the first decision tree got wrong, then gets a second decision tree whose opinion will matter more because of the increase in weights (a 20 year old). AdaBoost makes this tree classify the dataset (second opinion). This classification will be better but it will still get some wrong (he only just finished college). \n",
    "- AdaBoost will again assign even larger weights to the wrongly classified data, then bring in a third decision tree whose opinion matters a lot (our wise old man), AdaBoost politely asks this tree to classify the data (third opinion). This classification will also contain errors (he's only human after all), but thats ok! AdaBoost got everything it needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, AdaBoost has three opinions, each with different weights. It will then combine these opinions by listening most to the highly weighted opinion and so on, until we get a classification that classifies our model as accurately as it can. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, in reality AdaBoost will usually use more than three opinions."

I debated putting age, but I figured as the tech market is very dominant at the moment and its mostly young people it would skew the results. But after further consideration it makes sense that age plays a high role, even in the tech world older people have more experience and are paid more. Hours per week caugt me by surprise. My reason was that working a lot at a low paying job wont get you a substantial income gain."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
